# Who Were They?

The Torres-Ortiz Family were originally from San Juan, Puerto Rico. Throughout the mid-20th century the family moved across the United States. We follow their journey not only to learn how they were able to integrate into American culture, but also what aspects of their own culture they chose to preserve.[^1]

## The Family Members

Gerardo Torres-Diaz was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico in 1891. His wife Maria Luisa Ortiz-Sedano, daughter of a Spanish father from the region of Santander and a Domican mother from Santo Domingo, was born three years later in 1894. It is unclear how and when the pair met, but they had a civil wedding ceremony on June 29th 1918. Two years later they would welcome their first child Gerardo a.k.a Gerry on May 6th 1920, followed by their second son Victor Manuel in 1921, and lastly Fabio was born in 1928. It is assumed that the family was of middle class due to Gerardo's job as a postal worker and the family's ability to speak English as reported in the 1930 census. Another hint as to their social standing is Maria Luisa's political activity in the 1930's. She donated the _Union de Puerto Rico_ in 1931. In the same year she recieved a letter where she is addressed as _“presidente sub junta de damas ‘Seccion Sur’”_ of the Liberal Party of Puerto Rico. Their reasos for leaving the island are unclear but by 1941 all members of the family were living in the US. Once it in New York the family added a new member to the mix, Mary Louise Martinez a.k.a Cookie, an adopted daugher born in 1942.

 ## Life in New York
 
Even though the Torres-Ortiz family arrived to New York a few years before the Great Migration, they did take part in preserving Puerto Rican culture on the mainland. In May of 1945 Gerardo Sr. and Maria Louisa attended the _Miembros de la Colonia Puertorriqueña en Nueva York_ event held in Audubon Hall on West 163rd St. Puerto Rican centered clubs and associations were not foreign to Gerardo Sr. In 1950 he was one of the founding members of _The Puerto-Rican Veterans Welfare Postal Workers Association_.

## Westardward We Go

Gerry was the first family member to move out west. According to a naturalization petition his wife Maye filed in 1949 the couple lived in San Francsico. In a letter written in June of 1951 to his brother Victor, Gerry revealed that he wanted to move his parents to California. Unfortunetly, Gerardo Sr. developed lung cancer. He retired from the post office in 1954. In Febuary of 1955 Gerardo took a flight to San Francisco. His health quickly deteriorated and he was emitted into The Veterans Hospital in Oakland, California. On March 23rd Gerardo Sr. passed away. Following his death, the rest of the family moved to the Bay Area. In San Francisco, Gerry was a part of the restaurant business. He was the proprietor of Scotty's Drive-in, “home of the foot long hot dog”. Victor was sport director and representative of KBRG radio station. Fabio also had some success aschairman of a beauty pageant called “The Latin American Fiesta of 1968”. Mary Louise is by far the most mysterious of the Torres-Ortiz clan. The only proof of her existence in the family collection are of photographs left behind. The only additional information available is of her marriage in 1962 to Gilbert Shine and later the couple's divorce in 1967. Life for Maria Luisa after her husband's death is not documented. Information on when Maria Luisa died I could not find, but there was a letter addressed to her from California Senator Milton Marks, a friend of Fabio. In it Marks says that he heard Maria Luisa was ill and hoped “that each day finds you better and that you will soon be fine again.” At the time of the letter Maria Luisa was nearing 76 years old, so it is possible to assume that she might have passed sometime around the late 70’s.
