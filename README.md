# Who Were They?

The Torres-Ortiz Family were originally from San Juan, Puerto Rico. Throughout the mid-20th century the family moved across the United States. We follow their journey not only to learn how they were able to integrate into American culture, but also what aspects of their own culture they chose to preserve.

# Basic usage

## The Family Members

Gerardo Torres-Diaz was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico in 1891. His wife Maria Luisa Ortiz-Sedano, daughter of a Spanish father from the region of Santander and a Domican mother from Santo Domingo, was born three years later in 1894. It is unclear how and when the pair met, but they had a civil wedding ceremony on June 29th 1918. Two years later they would welcome their first child Gerardo a.k.a Gerry on May 6th 1920, followed by their second son Victor Manuel in 1921, and lastly Fabio was born in 1928. It is assumed that the family was of middle class due to Gerardo's job as a postal worker and the family's ability to speak English as reported in the 1930 census. Another hint as to their social standing is Maria Luisa's political activity in the 1930's. She donated the _Union de Puerto Rico_ in 1931. In the same year she recieved a letter where she is addressed as _“presidente sub junta de damas ‘Seccion Sur’”_ of the Liberal Party of Puerto Rico. Their reasos for leaving the island are unclear but by 1941 all members of the family were living in the US. Once it in New York the family added a new member to the mix, Mary Louise Martinez a.k.a Cookie, an adopted daugher born in 1942.
